# Welcome to the evalution task for the GSoC Project "High Granularity Quantization for CICADA"

### :warning: After accepting the invitation to this git repo, you have 48 hours to work on your solution :warning:

## The task
The two files `data/images.npy` and `data/labels.npy` are to be analyzed with some machine learning. 
 - Describe the data (with suitable plots)
 - Load the model stored in `model/`, describe what it does and evaluate its performance
 - Develop a small model that performs better than the provided one

 Conduct your work in a jupyter notebook. Auxiliary classes and functions can be extracted to standard `.py` files 

## Submitting your solution
Conduct all your work in a private github repository and invite Lino (https://github.com/ligerlac) as a collaborator. Do not share your solution with others or make your github repo public before March 27.

## Evaluation
The instructions above are vague and don't specify the content of the data or how to evalute the provided model's performance. This is deliberate in order to test your general problem-solving skills and coding qualities. Also, 48 hours is not much time for this task. You may not finish the assignment completely. The way you approach the problem is therefore more important than the final result, so explain what you are doing and why. Use well-named variables and functions and informative commit messages. Only changes made within 48 hours after accepting the invitation to this repository are considered.

## Good luck!
